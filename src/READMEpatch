This is a patch to Keldon's Race for the Galaxy AI, version 0.8.1.

Information about the project can be found at http://keldon.net/rftg/, and the
source code can be downloaded from http://warpcore.org/rftg/rftg-0.8.1.tar.bz2.

These source files replace the corresponding files from the 0.8.1 version.

You must also copy the new icon files (icon0xx.png) to your installation folder
in order to get the new icons.

This patch introduces the following additional command line option:

	-n <name>      -- Set the name of the human player
	-s <savegame>  -- A save game to load when starting the program
	-g, -nog       -- Enable or disable goals
	-t, -not       -- Enable or disable takeovers

Else the instructions and notes are equivalent to the original version and can
be found in the file README.

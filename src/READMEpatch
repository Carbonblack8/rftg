NEW COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

This patch introduces the following additional command line options:

	-n <name>      -- Set the name of the human player
	-s <savegame>  -- A save game to load when starting the program
	-g, -nog       -- Enable or disable goals
	-t, -not       -- Enable or disable takeovers

RIGHT-CLICK

If you need to select a lot of cards (for instance for discarding), you
can now select a card to keep by right-clicking it.  Then all other
cards will be selected.

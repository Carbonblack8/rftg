This is a patch to Keldon's Race for the Galaxy AI, version 0.8.1.

Information about the project can be found at http://keldon.net/rftg/, and the
source code can be downloaded from http://warpcore.org/rftg/rftg-0.8.1.tar.bz2.

These source files replace the corresponding files from the 0.8.1 version.

You must also copy the new icon files (icon0xx.png) to your installation folder
in order to get the new icons.

This patch introduces the following additional command line option:

	-n <name>      -- Set the name of the human player
	-s <savegame>  -- A save game to load when starting the program
	-g, -nog       -- Enable or disable goals
	-t, -not       -- Enable or disable takeovers

Since the numeric key shortcuts interfere with the online chat box, the
1-9 accelerator keys have been removed for online play, and the following
accelerator keys have been added:

	F1:            Explore: +5
	Shift+F1:      Explore: +1, +1
	F2:            Develop
	Shift+F2:      Second Develop (in advanced game)
	F3:            Settle
	Shift+F3:      Second Settle (in advanced game)
	F4:            Consume-Trade
	Shift+F4:      Consume-x2
	F5:            Produce
	F6:            Search (in The Brink of War)
	F7:            Prestige action (in The Brink of War)

	F1-F9 and Shift+F1-Shift+F9:
	               Activate selectable cards in tableaux and hand

	Shift+Enter:   'Done' button
	Shift+Up/Down: Change selection in drop down
	F12:           Open selection drop down

Else the instructions and notes are equivalent to the original version and can
be found in the file README.

This is a patch to Keldon's Race for the Galaxy AI, version 0.8.1.

Information about the project can be found at http://keldon.net/rftg/, and the
source code can be downloaded from http://warpcore.org/rftg/rftg-0.8.1.tar.bz2.

The source code for this release can be found at http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7379896/rftg-0.8.1c-source.zip.

Copy these files into your rftg installation directory:
 rftg8c.exe:
    The program itself

    Some new icons

This patch introduces the following additional command line option:

	-s <savegame>  -- A save game to load when starting the program.
	-g, -nog       -- Enable or disable goals
	-t, -not       -- Enable or disable takeovers

Else the instructions and notes are equivalent to the original version and can
be found in the file README.

Since you read this, this is a bonus tip to you: If you download these two
files, and put them in your installation folder (overwriting what's already
there, loading times will be drastically reduced.

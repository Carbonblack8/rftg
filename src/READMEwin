This patch introduces the following additional command line option:

	-n <name>      -- Set the name of the human player
	-s <savegame>  -- A save game to load when starting the program.
	-g, -nog       -- Enable or disable goals
	-t, -not       -- Enable or disable takeovers

Since the numeric key shortcuts interfere with the online chat box, the
1-9 accelerator keys have been removed for online play, and the following
accelerator keys have been added:

	F1:            Explore: +5
	Shift+F1:      Explore: +1, +1
	F2:            Develop
	Shift+F2:      Second Develop (in advanced game)
	F3:            Settle
	Shift+F3:      Second Settle (in advanced game)
	F4:            Consume-Trade
	Shift+F4:      Consume-x2
	F5:            Produce
	F6:            Search (in The Brink of War)
	F7:            Prestige action (in The Brink of War)

	F1-F9 and Shift+F1-Shift+F9:
	               Activate selectable cards in tableaux and hand

	Shift+Enter:   'Done' button
	Shift+Up/Down: Change selection in drop down
	F12:           Open selection drop down

Else the instructions and notes are equivalent to the original version and can
be found in the file README.

Since you are already reading this, this is a bonus tip to you: If you download
these two files, and put them in your installation folder (overwriting what's
already there), loading times will be drastically reduced.
